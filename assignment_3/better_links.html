            <p><a href=
            "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/everything-spotify-knows-about-you/">
            Spotify knows a lot about its users</a>-- their musical tastes,
            their most listened-to artists and their summer anthems. Spotify
            will also want to know where you live or to obtain your location
            data. It's part of an effort to detect fraud and abuse of its
            Premium Family program.</p>

            <p>Premium Family is a $15-a-month plan for up to six people.
            The only condition is that they all live at the same address.
            But the streaming music giant is concerned about people abusing
            that plan to pay as little as $2.50 for its services. So in August,
            Spotify updated its
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/premium-family-terms/">
            terms and conditions for Premium Family subscribers</a>,
            requiring that they provide location data "from time to time" to
            ensure that customers are actually all in the same family.</p>

            <p>You have 30 days to cancel after the new terms went into effect,
            which depends on where you are. The family plan terms rolled out
            first on Aug. 19 in Ireland and on Sept. 5 in the US.</p>

            <p><a href=
            "https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/spotify-ends-test-that-required-family-plan-subscribers-to-share-their-gps-location/">
            Spotify have previously asked for exact GPS coordinates</a> but
            ended the pilot program after customers balked, according to TechCrunch.
            Now it intends on rolling the location data requests out fully,
            reigniting privacy concerns and raising the question of how much
            is too much when it comes to your personal information.</p>

            <p><q>The changes to the policy allow Spotify to arbitrarily use the
            location of an individual to ascertain if they continue to reside
            at the same address when using a family account, and it's unclear
            how often Spotify will query users' devices for this information,</q>
            said Christopher Weatherhead, technology lead for UK watchdog group
            Privacy International, adding that there are "worrying privacy
            implications."</p>

            <p>Location data is particularly sensitive, as it hands out information
            on where you've been, giving companies and advertisers details about
            your personal life. Even when the data is anonymized, location
            data is often so specific that it only takes
            <a href=
            "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html">
            a few steps to figure out who the location data are linked to</a>.
            In New York, <a href=
            "https://www.cnet.com/news/new-york-privacy-bill-could-ban-selling-phone-location-data/">
            lawmakers are considering a bill banning apps from sharing people's
            location data</a> within the city.</p>

            <p>With 108 million subscribers, <a href=
            "https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-subscribers-earnings-hit-108-million-apple-music/">
            Spotify is the dominant force in streaming music</a>. Its closest
            competitor, <a href=
            "https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-music-review/">Apple Music</a>
            , has 60 million subscribers.</p>

            <p>Spotify, whose premium service doesn't serve up ads,
            maintains that it's only using your location data for verification.</p>

            <p><q>This data is encrypted and can be edited by the plan owner as
            needed,</q> the company said in a statement. <q>The location data
            that is collected during Premium Family account creation is only
            used by Spotify for that purpose.</q></p>

            <p>Once you sign up for the family plan, Spotify will ask those on
            the plan to provide the company a home address using Google Maps.
            Every person added to the plan will have to do the same, or enable
            location services for Spotify on their devices, the company said.
            Spotify said it doesn't use that home location data for advertising
            and that it doesn't store the data for internal use.</p>

            <p><q>Once verification of a family member's home address is completed,
            we do not store their location data or track their location at any
            time,</q> a Spotify spokesperson said.</p>

            <p>But there are some flaws in this methodology. It overlooks families
            that aren't living together, whether it's because kids are off to
            college or they have separated parents. It's also overlooking the
            privacy concerns with giving your location data away, experts said.</p>

            <p>And this won't be a one-time scenario. The notice said that Spotify
            could ask for location data to check for fraud "from time to time"
            but didn't specify when or how frequently those checks would happen.</p>

            <p>While <a href=
            "https://www.cnet.com/news/google-tightens-grip-on-some-android-data-over-privacy-fears-report-says/">
            Google has its own privacy concerns</a>, privacy experts suggest
            that it's better to use the Google Maps option rather than turning
            on your real-time location data for Spotify.</p>

            <p><q>That does seem to entail giving up quite a bit of personal
            information,</q> said April Doss, head of the cybersecurity and privacy
            law practice at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr and the National Security
            Agency's former associate general counsel for intelligence law.
            <q>Consequently, it's important that Spotify has created a less
            intrusive option for users, with manual data entry to residence
            location rather than ongoing monitoring of the person's location.
            </q></p>

            <p>A Google spokesman pointed to the <a href=
            "https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Google Maps Platform's
            privacy policy</a>, which notes that clients like Spotify need to
            have complete consent to use location data from customers.</p>

            <p>The change also brings up privacy concerns for children who are
            on their parents' family plans. You have to be over 13 years old to
            use Spotify, but the location data requirements still set off alarms
            for privacy experts.</p>

            <p><q>It seems excessive to permanently track individuals for this
            purpose,</q> Weatherhead said. <q>Additionally, it poses the problem
            of Spotify inadvertently tracking children and minors, who aren't
            legally able to consent or object.</q></p>
